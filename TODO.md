- double check tooltip accessibility [https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/accessibility/](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/accessibility/)

- lazy load in images to chart [see angular in depth](https://blog.angularindepth.com/a-modern-solution-to-lazy-loading-using-intersection-observer-9280c149bbc)

* scroller
  - don't iterate over every image when setting/changing classes (directives?)
  - \*ngIf for mobile/desktop images. `isSmallScreen$` is already in the class
  - scrollama class to share w/ later page?

- abstract `styles.scss` into component stylesheets
- smaller `title` class h1 font. 7rem -> 5rem, 5rem-4rem ?
- scrolling list, as with [angular.io docs](https://angular.io/api/core/QueryList)
- add mask to background on lightbox opening
