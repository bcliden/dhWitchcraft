                <p>The general purpose of this project is to create a digital methodology for understanding film genres and cycles. Our specific goal is to investigate the dialogue and images of one critically understudied genre, witch films, and draw conclusions about the emergence of patterns and trends over time. The project has three stages: (1) identifying a corpus of genre films, (2) collecting data from that corpus on textual and visual similarities between films, and (3) visualizing and analyzing collected data. We employed <a href="https://databasic.io/en/samediff/" target="_blank">SameDiff</a> for understanding the connection among dialogue in witch films and <a href="http://lab.softwarestudies.com/p/imageplot.html" target="_blank">ImagePlot</a> for a visual comparison of theatrical posters and film stills. This investigation reveals prototypical films, The <em>Witches of Eastwick</em> and <em>The Craft</em>; cycles, including the <em>Harry Potter</em> franchise and the made-for-television witch film trend; and outliers, including <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em> and <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>. This study reveals the complex inner workings of genre film production, capitalism, and the tradition of co-opting witchcraft—a symbol of import to various marginalized cultures—within U.S. film and media.</p>

        <h3>Witches, Genres, and Cycles</h3>
        <p><span class="dropcap">G</span>enre film has familiar narratives, characters, and aesthetics. An extraterrestrial invades Earth. A slasher slowly kills off a group of teenagers until one girl escapes. A lone outlaw rides off into the sunset. These patterns are a way for the Hollywood studio system to capitalize on the popularity of one film, turning it into a modular and repeatable type, a generic formula. While there is an overwhelming amount of research on certain film genres, a number of others remain critically understudied. Our research aims to establish a method for the digital analysis of one corpus of understudied genre films, witch films—a genre that, according to critic Sarah Ward, pivots on the tension between oppositions to normality and structures of power.</p>
        <p>Ward continues on to argue that “as a term, a practice and a label commonly denouncing spiritual activities that defy dominant beliefs, witchcraft comes to the screen loaded with meaning” (35). Although witches figure in almost every society across the globe, they occupy a unique space in American culture and history. From “witch trials” during the early colonial period to the present-day politicized “witch-hunts,” America has obsessed over witches for centuries. Culturally, the witch has been bound up in America’s tumultuous relationships with religion, gender, and sexuality. Scholars tie popular witch media to their corresponding historical moments, particularly moments of unrest and paranoia—for example, one cannot extricate Arthur Miller’s play <em>The Crucible</em> (1953) from McCarthyism, nor can one detach <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> (Roman Polanski, 1968) from the political unrest of the 1960s (Ward 37-40). When witchcraft became aligned with the women’s liberation movement in the 1970s, interest in and media representations of witches boomed (Foltz). After this influx of interest, images of witches appear more domesticated. More witch comedies including television shows like <em>Bewitched</em> (ABC, 1964–1972) appear, leading to the television boom of more light-hearted representations, such as <em>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</em> (Tibor Takács, 1996), <em>Halloweentown</em> (Duwayne Dunham, 1998), and <em>Twitches</em> (Stuart Gillard, 2005). This is indicative of the overall increase of witch films in this period, which we recognize as the mass production of witch films from the release of <em>The Witches of Eastwick</em> (George Miller) in 1987 to the release of <em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part Two</em> (David Yates) in 2011. According to some, this represents the taming of the witch, from violent or sexual threats to domesticated, loving, hard-working women of capitalism (Gibson 184).</p>
        <p>However, concurrent horror films such as <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> (Daniel Myrick & Eduardo Sanchez, 1999), and The Conjuring (James Wan, 2013) recall the fear of difference that buoyed early representations of witches, while those like <em>The Craft</em> (Andrew Fleming, 1996) reflected both a potential for liberation and punishment bound up in witchcraft. Sue Short, writing of <em>The Craft</em>, notes the female characters’ willingness to accept their status as outsiders and in fact embracing their exile as an “alternative to existing norms” (105). Of course, in the end only one member of the coven—the most “normal” among the four teenage girls—remains empowered. There have been few comprehensive studies of the witch film genre, which began with the U.S. release of the silent film <em>Häxan</em> in 1929 (Benjamin Christensen).</p>
        <p>In 1973, Andrew Tudor centered sociological and psychological context in his definition of genre, arguing that genre is “what we collectively believe it to be” (139). That is, genre “is not a way in which a critic classifies films for methodological purposes, but the much looser way in which an audience classifies its films” (145). While scholars and fans widely label witch films as such, what allows us to come to this agreement is much more complex than simply pointing to commonalities. Instead, the genre is defined and created by cultural consensus. “Like film genres,” Amanda Klein writes, “film cycles are a series of films associated with each other through shared images, characters, settings or themes” (4). She goes on to establish the difference between genre and cycle:</p>
        <blockquote>However, while film genres are primarily defined by the repetition of key images (their semantics) and themes (their syntax), film cycles are primarily defined by how they are used (their pragmatics). In other words, the formation and longevity of film cycles are a direct result of their immediate financial viability as well as the public discourses circulating around them, including film reviews, director interviews, studio-issued press kits, movie posters, theatrical trailers. (4)</blockquote>
        <p>The center of film cycles are studios’ attempts to cater to audience desires and expectations. If an audience enjoys a film (i.e., if a film earns a studio impressive returns at the box office or garners fan attention), the studio will copy some or all of it, the semantics or syntax, and graft these elements onto a new film. Cycles are about films’ use-value and profitability; these are commodities, usually produced as quickly as possible. While cycles and genre function differently for the our discussion of witch films, both are crucial for an understanding of how generic formulas reflect both audience and studio demands.</p>

        <h3>Digital Humanities Projects on Film</h3>
        <p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e seek to position this project within a network of burgeoning scholarship on large-scale data mining of film. With the onset of data mining digital humanities projects, we are now equipped with the tools for studying large scale textual and visual trends more efficiently. <a href="http://moviesincolor.com/" target="_blank">Movies in Color</a> analyses the usage of color in film using color drop tools; the in-progress project <a href="https://www.distantviewing.org/" target="_blank">Distant Viewing</a> takes on the movement of images; <a href="https://www.ims.tuwien.ac.at/projects/digital-formalism" target="_blank">Digital Formalism</a> examines visual elements of film to consider how formal techniques contribute to overall narrative structures. The tool <a href="http://www.scripthreads.org" target="_blank">ScripThreads</a> identifies patterns of character interactions in screenplays. Meanwhile, projects from <em>The Pudding</em>, such as <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/03/film-dialogue/" target="_blank">“Film Dialogue from 2,000 Screenplays, Broken Down by Gender and Age”</a> and <a href="https://pudding.cool/2017/03/bechdel/" target="_blank">“Hollywood’s Gender Divide and Its Effect on Films,”</a> rely strictly on text mining.</p>
        <p>Finding throughlines and divergences in thousands of hours of footage is possible in ways that it hasn’t been before, but methodologies for this have not yet been developed or tested. Considering that films are multimodal by design, telling and showing stories through sound, visual, narrative, and spectacle, the fact that all prior projects have stuck to either the text or the visual component of films elides the reality of the cinematic form. This is where our project hopes to intervene, first by doing a combined digital analysis of both dialogue and visuals. (We hope to incorporate sound in the future.) At its core, this project is an experiment that uses digital tools in order to understand film genre and cycles.</p>

        <h3>After the Witching Hour...</h3>
        <p><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter the boom of witch films (1987-2011), the trends seem to change. In the last few years, the number of action-adventure witch films has flourished. Here we refer to <em>The Huntsman</em> films (Rupert Sanders, 2012; Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, 2016), <em>Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters</em> (Tommy Wirkola, 2013), and <em>The House of the Devil</em> (Breck Eisner, 2015). Alongside these, we see a resurgence of independent witch films, such as <em>The House of the Devil</em> (Ti West, 2009), <em>Antichrist</em> (Lars von Trier, 2009), <em>The Witch</em> (Roger Eggers, 2015), and <em>The Love Witch</em> (Anna Biller, 2016). The last two of these have received critical acclaim and suggest possible new watershed moments, although it is certainly too soon to tell. Nonetheless, they continue to rely on certain semantic elements, alongside the syntactics of the witch in American culture.</p>
        <p>As our graph of Halloweentown reveals, the most significant trends in our analysis center on made-for-television films. The success of <em>Halloweentown</em> prompted several sequels, including <em>Halloweentown II: Kalabar’s Revenge</em> (Mary Lambert, 2001), <em>Halloweentown High</em> (Mark A. Z. Dippe, 2004), and <em>Return to Halloweentown</em> (David Jackson, 2006). But it also was the beginning of a cycle of TV-G and TV-PG films throughout the 2000s, including <em>Sabrina the Teenage Witch</em> and two ongoing series, <em>Twitches</em>, and <em>The Good Witch</em> (Craig Pryce, 2015). Each of these films bears linguistic similarity to the others and marks a clear cycle within the witch film genre.</p>
        <p>In phase two of Digital Witchcraft, we expect to add complexity and detail to the project’s approach. First, we will run the rest of our corpus through SameDiff, accompanied by a further exploration of specific language use in the scripts using Voyant. We will explore further the affordances of ImagePlot, while also considering other visual analysis tools. Do CSS for all of the corpus? With another dimension of film in mind, we will search for sound analysis tools. Lastly, we will develop interactive graphs for our data to make them more readable and explorable.</p>
